# Simple sentiment analysis with Python and Tensorflow
Extracting polarity from arbitrary text is not an easy task with traditional methods.
Machine Learning (ML) makes it possible to create models which can solve this task in an easy manner.
This project was aimed to gain some experience with Tensorflow and Python. Therefore, the code quality
could be improved for sure ;)

Project is based on the awesome tutorial from https://pythonprogramming.net/

Data is retrieved from http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/

Just download and copy the files directly into folder called **data** and rename the files to **train-data.csv** & **test-data.csv**

**Have fun**
